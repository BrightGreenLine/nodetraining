# Experimenting with node.js

This is an experiment with node.js, teaching
myself all of the necessary tools (freeBSD,
git/gitHub, nginx, and CoffeeScript)

# About what you see here

This project started off initially following
the tutorial "The Node Beginner Book"
by Manuel Kiessling

Of course, it's all written in CoffeeScript
instead of Javascript, as the book uses
JavaScript instead.
